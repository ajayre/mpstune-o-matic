1. Use DB9 connector for MPS
 - four pins for MPS
 - 5V
 - GND
 - three generic I/O for future use

2. Custom cable - DB9 to MPS connector (version Cush uses)

3. Do we need pots for calibration so all MPS tune-o-matics produce the same pulse width under the same conditions for the same MPS? Could calibration be done without an MPS?
Obvious place is the SC+IM bias voltage

4. Calibration pot for air temp - set to specific voltage

5. Expose calibration pots through holes in case to fit a small screwdriver?

6. Calibration mode on touch screen:

  - connect reference MPS
  - turn calib pot to desired target pulse width
  - confirm

this stores target pulse width in nvol
