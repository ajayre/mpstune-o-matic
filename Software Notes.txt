1. Prompt user to change vacuum 0, 1, 2, ..., 15. When tuning done show chart comparing their MPS to the benchmark MPS pulse width vs vacuum.

2. O2 tuned MPSs need to also state fuel pressure.

3. Multiple benchmark O2 tuned MPSs with different fuel pressures so user can choose which one matches their current fuel pressure

4. Show current pressure and pulse width and corrected pulse width for benchmark pressure (sea level?)

5. Each MPS in database has a one-line description

6. Allow user to store their MPS in the database once tuned. Also need a way of deleting and sharing? Export/import MPS?

7. Before tuning capture the current MPS setting so it can be returned to later if user is not happy. "Create MPS profile"

8. Is only one vacuum setting needed for tuning?

9. MPS profile has checkbox "unaltered" so we can automatically generate an average of all unaltered MPSs in the database.

10. Document T-o-M calibration procedures.

11. Generate stats/report such as % change in pulse width from 0 inHg to 15 inHg
